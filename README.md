# Hi, I'm Santi Redondo

I was born in bariloche. Now I'm 21 years old and this year I moved to buenos aires to focus on my studies. I'm deeply interested in self-discovery, personal growth, and spirituality, constantly pushing myself to know more and embrace vulnerability. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of programming and aspire to work as a freelancer, building trust with clients and eventually establishing a web development agency. While it's challenging for me to talk about my soft skills, I've received positive feedback on my listening ability, empathy, leadership, and direct communication. I enjoy uncovering my strengths and weaknesses to grow in all aspects.


## Some hobbies

My principal hobbies are going to the gym and playing soccer with my friends. Talking about depth subjects is something that I could do for hours. In solitude I enjoy studying, working, writing some ponders or filosofical thoughts, or even cooking with some music. I use to start the day reading some pages or taking a breath to wake up with positive attitude.


## Why web development?

Sincerely I was struck by how well some people made money and the fact that they could work remotely, in other words they could travel around the world. Over time, and delving deeper into personal growth I realize that money and travel wasn't what I really wanted, coincidentally I ended up not only liking it but pushing me to solve problems and it's very interesting how much I can learn (whether technical or soft skills) every day, trying some new codes, building projects or connecting with new people.


## Some technologies I'm familiar with
